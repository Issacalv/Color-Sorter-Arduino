# Checker-Color-Sorter-Arduino
For our final project for Microcomputers 1, we were tasked to be creative and utilize all  previous knowledge we gathered from our class labs to create a project. With the help of fellow classmates Matt Ludwig and Alex Paez, we decided it would be a great idea to base our project around a TCS3200 Color Recognition Sensor. Due to monetary, practicality, and time constraints, we decided that we should make the sensor be able to identify red and black checker pieces and sort them. Therefore the color sensor would be able to recognize between three different conditions:
